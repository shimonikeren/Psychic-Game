# Psychic-Game

In this project, I have created a fun and fucntional working game,  using only javascript, html, and css (and css bootstrap).

Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. The user gets 9 choices per round. 

The page will update according to user choices (wins, losses, guesses left, guesses so far).

Hope you enjoy my Psychic game!
