The Psychic Game is a dynamic game where the computer generates a random letter and the user has to guess the letter. User gets 10 opportunities to guess the correct letter. If they guess correctly, their win count goes up, if they get 10/10 guesses incorrect, their loss count goes up. The game resets after every round, but the win/loss count remains until the browser closes or is refreshed.
